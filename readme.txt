welp this project has creating too long for that small size work ik but i can say why i making it so long here a reason

i was got problem with my previous laptop i got too many BSOD's and i thinked i got just trouble with windows but that not is it and send my laptop to service center for

diagnosting and this service center said bro that OOF for u bc ur central processor is dead lol my face in this time: WTF? how it is i can be dead bc i can use it a little

bit i can how really? but anyway my laptop has a not stable and it was so unstable that I was afraid to even write code because it would go down the drain yeah that true 

that a reason why i dont active an GitHub like 3 weeks+- but now i will be more active i want doing 1+ commit per a 2 days now but later i will start learning JS 

and i will stop to commit ig or maybe i will solve problems from codewars or leetcode and i will commit it maybe, bc activity and why not really? welp thanks for reading this

text maybe this so not interesting but that is.
